Task-3:
This files contains information about task performed as well as Advantages of steganography and cryptography.
Here steg_image is a normal image of a car downloaded through web browser.
steg_text is a normal text file which contains the information that has to be binded with the image steg_image.
At first we perform steganography operation through quickstego and we bind steg_image and steg_text and we get the output file as task3_steg which is a BMP file.
Then we decrypt that BMP file using quick stego that is present in the Screenshot(58).
After that we perform steganography operation through command prompt. Here we bind steg_image and steg_text through command prompt and we get a jpeg file called steg_cmd. The screenshot of this operation is present in encryption_cmd.
And we decrypt this file by opening steg_cmd through notepad.At the end of many texts there is the message. And it's screenshot is in Screenshot(59).PNG. 
Cryptography Advantages:
Cryptography's primary goal is to ensure that only authorized peoples can access and understand sensitive information. Encryption transforms data into an unreadable format, protecting it from unauthorized access.
Cryptographic techniques, such as hashing, ensure that data remains unaltered during transmission or storage. This helps detect any tampering or modifications.
Cryptography enables the verification of the sender's or receiver's identity. Digital signatures and certificates provide assurance that data originates from a legitimate source.
Cryptography can provide proof that a specific action occurred, preventing individuals from denying their involvement. Digital signatures, for example, can serve as evidence of a transaction.
Cryptography is essential for secure online communication, protecting sensitive information exchanged over networks. This is vital for applications like online banking, e-commerce, and secure messaging.
Cryptography is used to protect stored data, ensuring that even if unauthorized access occurs, the data remains unreadable.
Many industries and regulations require the use of cryptography to protect sensitive data, such as financial or healthcare information.

Steganography Advantages:
Steganography's  hides every thing of a message including numbers ,alphabets and special characters. This makes it fully secure.
Steganography allows for discreet communication, especially in situations where encryption might raise suspicion.
In some cases, steganography can be used to bypass censorship or surveillance systems that monitor encrypted traffic.
Encrypted data can be hidden within another file, making it even harder to detect.
